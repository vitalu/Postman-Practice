# Postman API Automation Integration with GitHub Actions #

This repository is a demonstration for a POC for integrating Postman with GitHub Actions. The tests are written in Postman and executed on the VM using Newman and the Newman Reporter HTML Extra.

The HTML report is archived and kept in the artifact section for the team to download. Along with that, they can view the report directly from the GitHub page "https://vitalu.github.io/Postman-Practice/"
